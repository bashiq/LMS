The front end is split into four zones of permission: the dean (highest permissions), the department chair, the professor, and the student(lowest permissions). 

### Background
Background
Course evaluations provide a valuable compass for campus leadership because the success of any educational institution lies in the success of its student body. Efficiently and effectively creating and analyzing course evaluations will allow faculty to gauge which aspects of their curriculum and/or teaching style works well versus what students may struggle with. Capturing and analyzing this data properly can make year-over-year improvements in school administration.
